## 🔍 Common Issues & Quick Fixes

### Issue: Desktop Mobile Detection False Positive
**Symptom**: Desktop shows mobile overlay
**Quick Fix**: Check `window.deviceDetection.isMobile()` logic
**Test**: Verify user agent patterns and viewport width thresholds

### Issue: Orientation Overlay Doesn't Appear
**Symptom**: Portrait mode shows game instead of overlay
**Quick Fix**: Check OrientationManager initialization in LoadingScene
**Test**: Verify `window.orientationManager.getCurrentOrientation()`

### Issue: Touch Coordinates Wrong
**Symptom**: Touch events don't match visual elements
**Quick Fix**: Verify Phaser scale manager configuration
**Test**: Check canvas getBoundingClientRect() vs game coordinates

### Issue: Performance Degradation
**Symptom**: FPS drops below target
**Quick Fix**: Check for memory leaks and excessive DOM manipulation
**Test**: Monitor performance timeline in browser dev tools

### Issue: Game State Loss During Orientation
**Symptom**: Balance, settings reset after rotation
**Quick Fix**: Verify GameScene pause/resume integration
**Test**: Check game state persistence in OrientationManager
