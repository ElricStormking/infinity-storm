## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### RTP Out of Tolerance
```
❌ RTP: 94.2% (Target: 96.5% ±0.5%)
```
**Solutions:**
- Review symbol weights in `GameConfig.js`
- Check payout table calculations
- Validate multiplier distributions
- Increase sample size for better statistical significance

#### Mathematical Calculation Errors
```
❌ Symbol payout calculation failed
```
**Solutions:**
- Verify payout formulas: `(bet / 20) * multiplier`
- Check cluster size tier logic (8-9, 10-11, 12+)
- Validate free spins multiplier application

#### RNG Distribution Failures
```
❌ Chi-square test failed: 23.4 > 16.919
```
**Solutions:**
- Check RNG implementation for bias
- Verify weighted selection algorithms
- Increase entropy source quality

#### Performance Issues
```
⚠️ Performance: 543 spins/second (target: >1000)
```
**Solutions:**
- Optimize grid generation algorithms
- Reduce unnecessary object creation
- Use more efficient data structures

### Debug Mode

For detailed debugging, run with verbose output:

```bash
npm run test:rtp -- --verbose
```

### MCP Configuration

Ensure MCP connection is configured in the server:

```javascript
// In infinity-storm-server/server.js
const mcp = require('./mcp-integration');
await mcp.initialize();
```

## Regulatory Compliance

This validation system meets requirements for:

- **Nevada Gaming Commission**
- **Malta Gaming Authority** 
- **UK Gambling Commission**
- **Curacao eGaming**
- **ISO/IEC 17025 Testing Standards**

### Certification Process

1. Run full validation suite: `npm run compliance`
2. Review all generated reports
3. Address any compliance issues
4. Submit regulatory report for approval
5. Maintain ongoing monitoring

## Development Guidelines

### Adding New Tests

1. **RTP Validation Tests** - Add to `rtp-validation.js`
   ```javascript
   async validateNewFeature() {
       // Implementation
   }
   ```

2. **Mathematical Unit Tests** - Add to `game-math.test.js`
   ```javascript
   describe('New Feature Math', () => {
       test('should calculate correctly', () => {
           // Test implementation
       });
   });
   ```

### Modifying Tolerance Levels

Update tolerance in `rtp-validation.js`:

```javascript
constructor() {
    this.tolerance = 0.5; // ±0.5% for regulatory compliance
    this.targetRTP = 96.5;
}
```

### Performance Optimization

- Use seeded RNG for reproducible results
- Implement object pooling for large simulations
- Batch database operations
- Use streaming for large datasets

## Monitoring and Maintenance

### Scheduled Testing

Recommend running validation:
- **Daily**: Quick validation (`--quick`)
- **Weekly**: Standard validation  
- **Monthly**: Full validation (`--full`)
- **Before Releases**: Complete compliance validation

### Performance Monitoring

Track key metrics:
- RTP stability over time
- Test execution performance
- Memory usage trends
- Error rates and types

### Alert Thresholds

Set up alerts for:
- RTP deviation > ±0.3%
- Test failure rates > 5%
- Performance degradation > 20%
- Memory usage > 2GB during testing
