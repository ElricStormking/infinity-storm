## Running Tests

### Install Dependencies
```bash
cd src/tests/clientValidationIntegration
npm install
```

### Run All Tests
```bash
npm test
```

### Run Specific Test Suites
```bash
npm run test:cascade-api      # CascadeAPI validation features
npm run test:grid-manager     # GridManager validation integration

npm run test:integration      # End-to-end integration tests
```

### Coverage Reports
```bash
npm run test:coverage
```

### Watch Mode (for development)
```bash
npm run test:watch
```

## Test Environment

### Mocked Components
- **Phaser 3 Scene Environment**: Complete scene, tweens, input, events simulation
- **Web Crypto API**: SHA-256 hashing for validation hash generation
- **NetworkService**: WebSocket and HTTP communication mocking
- **GameConfig**: Complete game configuration with all required settings
- **Console Methods**: Silent test execution with call tracking

### Custom Matchers
- `toBeWithinTolerance(expected, tolerance)`: Validates numeric values within tolerance
- `toHaveValidationHash()`: Validates proper hash string format
- `toHaveSyncState(expectedState)`: Validates sync state status

### Test Utilities
- `generateMockGrid()`: Creates realistic 6x5 symbol grids
- `generateMockCascadeStep()`: Creates complete cascade step data
- `generateMockServerResponse()`: Creates server response simulation
- `waitFor(ms)`: Async operation waiting utility

## Key Test Scenarios

### 1. Hash Validation Consistency
Tests ensure that identical grid states produce identical hashes across all components, and that hash mismatches are properly detected and trigger recovery procedures.

### 2. Timing Synchronization
Validates that server timing data is properly synchronized across AnimationManager and CascadeAPI, with drift detection and correction mechanisms.

### 3. Step-by-Step Validation
Comprehensive testing of cascade step processing through all validation layers with proper acknowledgment and error handling.

### 4. Recovery Mechanisms  
Tests all recovery strategies (state_resync, step_replay, timing_adjustment, full_resync) with proper fallback handling.

### 5. Performance Under Load
Validates system performance with high-frequency operations, concurrent validation requests, and memory management.

### 6. Production Readiness
Tests production configuration, error reporting, backward compatibility, and graceful degradation scenarios.

## Success Criteria

All tests must pass with:
- ✅ **Hash Validation**: 100% consistency across components
- ✅ **Timing Synchronization**: Sub-100ms accuracy with drift detection  
- ✅ **Desync Recovery**: All recovery mechanisms functional
- ✅ **Performance**: <5 seconds for 50+ concurrent operations
- ✅ **Memory Management**: Automatic cleanup maintaining <50 item limits
- ✅ **Error Handling**: Graceful degradation for all failure scenarios
- ✅ **Integration**: Seamless cross-component communication
- ✅ **Production Ready**: Full backward compatibility maintained

The test suite includes comprehensive debug features:
- Detailed error reporting with context
- Performance metrics tracking  
- Memory usage validation
- Step-by-step execution tracing
- Component integration status monitoring
