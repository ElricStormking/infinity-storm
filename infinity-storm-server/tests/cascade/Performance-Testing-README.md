## Integration with CI/CD

### GitHub Actions Example

```yaml
name: Performance Tests
on:
  schedule:
    - cron: '0 2 * * *'  # Daily at 2 AM
  workflow_dispatch:

jobs:
  performance-tests:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      
      - name: Setup Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          node-version: '18'
          
      - name: Install Dependencies
        run: |
          cd infinity-storm-server
          npm install
          
      - name: Run Performance Tests
        run: |
          cd infinity-storm-server
          node --expose-gc tests/cascade/runPerformanceTests.js
          
      - name: Upload Performance Report
        uses: actions/upload-artifact@v3
        with:
          name: performance-report
          path: infinity-storm-server/tests/cascade/performance-report.json
```

## Production Monitoring Integration

### Metrics Collection

The performance tests establish baseline metrics that should be monitored in production:

```javascript
// Example production metrics integration
const performanceMetrics = {
  cascadeProcessingTime: histogram('cascade_processing_duration_seconds'),
  concurrentSessions: gauge('concurrent_cascade_sessions'),
  memoryUsage: gauge('cascade_system_memory_bytes'),
  errorRate: counter('cascade_processing_errors_total')
};
```

### Alerting Thresholds

Based on performance test results, set up production alerting:

- **Response Time**: Alert if >2000ms average over 5 minutes
- **Memory Usage**: Alert if heap growth >100MB over 1 hour
- **Error Rate**: Alert if >5% errors over 15 minutes
- **Concurrent Sessions**: Alert if >80% of tested maximum capacity

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Memory Issues**: Run with `--expose-gc` flag for accurate memory testing
2. **Timeout Errors**: Increase timeout values in performance-config.json
3. **Connection Failures**: Check if ports are available and services are running
4. **High Resource Usage**: Run tests on dedicated hardware or containers

### Performance Optimization

Based on test results, consider:

1. **High Response Times**: Optimize cascade processing algorithms
2. **Memory Leaks**: Review object lifecycle and garbage collection
3. **Low Throughput**: Implement request queuing and batching
4. **Resource Exhaustion**: Add resource pooling and connection limits

## Test Environment Requirements

- **Node.js**: v14+ (v18+ recommended)
- **Memory**: 4GB+ available RAM
- **CPU**: 4+ cores recommended
- **Disk**: 1GB+ available space
- **Network**: Stable connection for WebSocket tests

## Success Criteria

The performance test suite validates:

âœ… **High-Frequency Processing**: System handles 100+ rapid requests efficiently  
âœ… **Memory Management**: No memory leaks during extended operations  
âœ… **Concurrent Operations**: Perfect isolation between 50+ concurrent sessions  
âœ… **Resource Utilization**: Stable resource consumption under extreme load
