### Task 15.1.3: Network Interruption Recovery
- **Sync session recovery**: Tests recovery from interrupted synchronization sessions
- **WebSocket disconnection handling**: Validates reconnection and state restoration
- **Progressive recovery escalation**: Tests different recovery strategies (state_resync → phase_replay → cascade_replay → full_replay)
- **Recovery validation**: Ensures successful recovery and continued operation

### Task 15.1.4: Payout Accuracy Verification
- **Multi-step payout calculation**: Validates cumulative win calculations across cascades
- **Server-client payout comparison**: Ensures client and server calculations match
- **Multiplier accuracy**: Tests multiplier application in free spins and special modes
- **Fraud detection**: Validates detection of payout manipulation attempts

### Task 15.1.5: Performance Under Load (Additional)
- **Concurrent session handling**: Tests multiple simultaneous cascade synchronization sessions
- **Large sequence performance**: Validates performance with extended cascade sequences
- **Resource efficiency**: Monitors memory and CPU usage during intensive operations

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Test Timeouts**: Increase Jest timeout or use `--fast` mode for development
2. **Port Conflicts**: Tests use random ports, but ensure no other services conflict
3. **Memory Issues**: Run with `--maxWorkers=1` for Jest to limit memory usage
4. **WebSocket Failures**: Check firewall settings and network connectivity

### Debug Options
- Use `--verbose` flag for detailed test output and metrics
- Check console logs for performance warnings and error details
- Monitor memory usage with built-in memory tracking
- Review test results JSON for detailed analysis

### CI/CD Integration
The test suite is designed for continuous integration:
- Deterministic results with configurable timeouts
- Comprehensive error reporting and exit codes
- Performance metrics suitable for trend analysis
- Memory and resource usage monitoring for regression detection

This comprehensive test suite ensures the Enhanced Cascade Synchronization system is production-ready and meets all functional, performance, and security requirements.
