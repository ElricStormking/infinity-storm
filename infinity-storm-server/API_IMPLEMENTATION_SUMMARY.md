# Core Game APIs Implementation Summary
**Task 5.1: Implement Core Game APIs - COMPLETED**

## Overview
Successfully implemented a comprehensive, production-ready API system that integrates all previous work (authentication, game engine, state management, anti-cheat, audit logging) into complete game API endpoints.

## Implemented Components

### 1. Game Controller (`src/controllers/game.js`)
**Primary Game Logic Controller**
- **Complete spin processing** with full game engine integration
- **Atomic transactions** for credit management with rollback protection
- **Session state updates** after each spin
- **Anti-cheat integration** with security validation
- **Comprehensive error handling** with detailed logging
- **Performance monitoring** with metrics tracking
- **Player statistics calculation** with historical analysis

**Key Methods:**
- `processSpin()` - Main spin endpoint with complete transaction handling
- `getGameState()` - Retrieve current player game state
- `updateGameState()` - Manual state updates with validation
- `getPlayerStats()` - Comprehensive player statistics
- `getGameStatus()` - System health and performance metrics

### 2. API Routes (`src/routes/api.js`)
**Complete RESTful API Endpoint Definitions**
- **POST /api/spin** - Process spin requests with full validation
- **GET /api/game-state** - Get current game state
- **PUT /api/game-state** - Update game state (admin/debugging)
- **GET /api/player-stats** - Get player statistics and analytics
- **GET /api/game-status** - System status and health checks
- **POST /api/buy-feature** - Feature purchases (prepared for implementation)
- **GET /api/spin-history** - Spin history (prepared for implementation)
- **GET /api/jackpots** - Jackpot information (prepared for implementation)
- **POST /api/validate-session** - Session validation
- **Admin endpoints** - Emergency controls and metrics

**Validation Features:**
- Complete request validation with express-validator
- Custom game-specific validation rules
- Comprehensive error handling with detailed messages
- Rate limiting and security middleware integration

### 3. Game Validation Middleware (`src/middleware/gameValidation.js`)
**Comprehensive Game-Specific Validation**
- **Spin request validation** with business logic
- **Rate limiting** (30 spins/min, 1000 spins/hour, 100ms cooldown)
- **Credit sufficiency checks** for real accounts
- **Demo mode restrictions** (max bet $10, feature limits)
- **State transition validation** with allowed field checks
- **Feature purchase validation** with cost verification
- **Player state validation** (account status, session validity)

**Security Features:**
- Anti-fraud detection patterns
- Player-specific limits enforcement
- Demo vs real account differentiation
- Automatic cleanup of expired rate limits
- Performance monitoring and statistics

### 4. Response Helper (`src/utils/responseHelper.js`)
**Standardized API Response Formatting**
- **Consistent response structure** across all endpoints
- **HTTP status code management** with proper categorization
- **Comprehensive error categorization** (400s, 500s, game-specific)
- **Performance timing** and request tracing
- **Game-specific error responses** (insufficient credits, anti-cheat, etc.)
- **Development vs production modes** with appropriate error detail levels

**Response Types:**
- Success responses with data and metadata
- Error responses with detailed categorization
- Paginated responses for lists
- Health check responses
- Game-specific error responses (insufficient credits, anti-cheat violations, etc.)

## Integration Architecture

### System Integration
```
Client Request → Authentication → Game Validation → Game Controller → Game Engine
                     ↓                ↓                    ↓              ↓
               Session Manager → State Manager → Database → Response Helper
                     ↓                ↓              ↓              ↓
               Anti-Cheat → Audit Logger → Transaction → Formatted Response
```
