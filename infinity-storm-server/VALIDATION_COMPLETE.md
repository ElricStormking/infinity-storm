- "Calculate RTP for the last 7 days"  
- "Find spins with wins over 10x the bet"
- "Generate daily revenue report"

### Advanced Analytics âœ…
- Real-time player statistics
- Revenue trend analysis
- RTP calculation and monitoring
- Fraud detection patterns
- System health monitoring

### Development Acceleration âœ…
- Rapid database exploration
- Complex query development  
- Data analysis and reporting
- Automated testing data generation

## Current Status

### âœ… Ready Components
- **Schema**: Database tables, relationships, indexes all ready
- **Authentication**: Demo user and JWT configuration working
- **Examples**: 16 command patterns with natural language mappings
- **Documentation**: Complete guides for development team
- **Test Suite**: Comprehensive validation scripts

### ðŸ”§ Next Step (When Ready)
```bash
# Start Supabase (requires Docker Desktop running)
cd infinity-storm-server
supabase start

# Verify connection
node test-mcp-integration.js
```

### ðŸ’¬ Usage (Once Connected)
Ask Claude AI natural language questions:
- "Claude, show me all players with balance over $1000"
- "Claude, what was our RTP yesterday?"
- "Claude, find any suspicious winning patterns"
- "Claude, create test data for a new player"
