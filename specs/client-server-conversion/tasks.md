  - Mathematical consistency checks (NaN/Infinity detection, precision validation)
  - Context-aware validation (creation, update, transition, persistence, recovery)
  - Transition validation ensuring only legal state changes are permitted

  - Asynchronous logging with configurable buffer sizes and flush intervals
  - Connection pooling and efficient database query patterns
  - Background cleanup tasks for session management and cache maintenance
  - Performance metrics tracking and monitoring integration

- **Integration Points Ready**: All systems designed for seamless API integration
  - StateManager exposes comprehensive session and state management APIs
  - AntiCheat provides validation methods for all game operation endpoints
  - StateValidator offers validation services for all data persistence operations
  - AuditLogger handles compliance logging for all system operations
  - Complete error handling and recovery mechanisms for production stability

**GameScene Server Integration Implementation (Task 6.2 Complete):**

- **Dual-Mode Architecture**: GameScene now supports both server-connected mode and demo mode fallback
  - `SERVER_MODE` configuration in GameConfig.js controls server integration
  - Automatic fallback to demo mode if server connection fails or GameAPI unavailable
  - Identical user experience maintained regardless of mode (server or demo)

- **Server Integration Pattern**: Complete event-driven architecture for server communication
  - GameAPI event listeners handle `spin_result`, `balance_update`, `game_state_change`, `auth_error`
  - Server spin processing maintains all existing animation sequences and timings
  - Loading states and error handling provide smooth user experience during server calls

- **Balance Synchronization**: Server-authoritative balance management with local display updates
  - `GameStateManager.setBalanceFromServer()` method for direct server balance updates
  - All server balance updates bypass local calculations to maintain server authority
  - Real-time balance updates through WebSocket events and HTTP responses

- **Animation Preservation**: Server results animated through existing client systems
  - Server-generated cascades played through existing `shakeMatches()` and `createShatterEffect()`
  - Grid state updates using existing `GridManager` methods and symbol recycling
  - All existing sound effects, timing, and visual feedback preserved identically

- **Error Resilience**: Comprehensive error handling with graceful degradation
  - Authentication errors trigger automatic demo mode switch with user notification
  - Server connection failures fall back to original client-only logic seamlessly
  - All error states maintain game stability and user session continuity

**Critical Implementation Patterns for Future Tasks**:
- All state operations require multi-layer validation (StateValidator + AntiCheat)
- Session management includes automatic cleanup and recovery mechanisms
- Audit logging is mandatory for all financial transactions and state changes
- Risk scoring system automatically applies restrictions for suspicious behavior
- Redis caching provides performance boost while maintaining data consistency
- Complete error handling ensures system stability under all conditions

**Session Validation Client Implementation (Task 7.1 Complete):**

- **Portal-First Architecture**: Complete implementation of casino-grade portal-first authentication
  - Game client never handles login/registration - only validates existing sessions from portal
  - SessionService manages all session lifecycle operations (validate, refresh, expire, redirect)
  - LoginScene deprecated and shows redirect message to portal for authentication
  - MenuScene validates session before displaying, automatically redirects if invalid

- **SessionService Architecture**: Comprehensive session management with enterprise security features
  - URL parameter extraction for portal handoff (session_token, refresh_token, expires_at)
  - localStorage persistence with automatic cleanup of expired sessions
  - Automatic session refresh with 10-minute buffer before expiry
  - Retry logic with exponential backoff for validation failures
  - Complete session status tracking and debugging information

- **Security Features**: Casino-grade security measures implemented
  - URL parameter cleanup after session extraction (prevents token exposure)
  - Token expiry validation both locally and server-side
  - Refresh token rotation support with extended validity periods
  - Automatic redirect to portal with reason codes for audit trail
  - Integration with NetworkService for authenticated API calls

- **Error Handling & Recovery**: Robust error handling for production reliability
  - Network timeout handling with configurable retry attempts
  - Graceful degradation for SessionService unavailability
  - Comprehensive console logging for debugging and audit purposes
  - Automatic fallback to portal authentication on any session failure

- **Integration Points**: Seamless integration with existing game systems
  - MenuScene shows validation state during session check
  - Debug mode displays session status and manual logout option
  - NetworkService automatically receives session tokens for API authentication
  - Game startup blocks until session validation completes or redirects to portal

**Key Implementation Patterns for Future Tasks**:
- Session validation must complete successfully before any game operations
- All API calls automatically include session tokens via NetworkService integration
- Session expiry triggers immediate redirect to portal (no local error handling needed)
- Portal URL configuration supports both development and production environments
- Complete audit trail maintained for all session lifecycle events
