# Mobile Horizontal Layout - Requirements Specification

## Feature Overview
Modify the Infinity Storm WebGL game client to properly display in landscape orientation on mobile devices while maintaining the 1920x1080 aspect ratio with letterboxing support and preserving desktop functionality.

## User Stories

### US-001: Mobile Landscape Display
**As a** mobile player  
**I want** the game to display in landscape orientation at 1920x1080 aspect ratio  
**So that** I can enjoy the full gaming experience on my mobile device  

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- **WHEN** a mobile user accesses the game **THEN** the system SHALL display the game in landscape orientation
- **WHEN** the device aspect ratio differs from 16:9 **THEN** the system SHALL add black letterbox bars to maintain proper proportions
- **WHEN** the game renders on mobile **THEN** the system SHALL maintain the exact 1920x1080 game canvas resolution
- **WHEN** touch inputs are received **THEN** the system SHALL correctly map touch coordinates to game space

### US-002: Desktop Compatibility Preservation
**As a** desktop player  
**I want** the game to continue working exactly as before  
**So that** my gaming experience remains unchanged  

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- **WHEN** a desktop user accesses the game **THEN** the system SHALL display using the existing Scale.FIT mode
- **WHEN** the browser window is resized on desktop **THEN** the system SHALL maintain proper scaling without letterboxing
- **WHEN** mouse inputs are received on desktop **THEN** the system SHALL process them using existing handlers
- **WHEN** the game runs on desktop **THEN** all UI elements SHALL remain in their current positions

### US-003: Responsive Scaling with Letterboxing
**As a** mobile player with a non-16:9 device  
**I want** the game to add letterbox bars when needed  
**So that** the game maintains correct proportions without distortion  

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- **WHEN** the device has a wider aspect ratio than 16:9 **THEN** the system SHALL add black bars on top and bottom
- **WHEN** the device has a narrower aspect ratio than 16:9 **THEN** the system SHALL add black bars on left and right
- **WHEN** letterbox bars are displayed **THEN** they SHALL be pure black (#000000) to match the game background
- **WHEN** the user taps on letterbox areas **THEN** the system SHALL ignore these inputs

### US-004: Orientation Lock and Handling
**As a** mobile player  
**I want** the game to guide me to use landscape orientation  
**So that** I can play the game as intended  

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- **WHEN** a mobile user accesses the game in portrait mode **THEN** the system SHALL display a rotation prompt
- **WHEN** the device is rotated to landscape **THEN** the system SHALL automatically adjust the display
- **WHEN** the orientation changes during gameplay **THEN** the system SHALL pause and prompt for rotation
- **WHEN** the game is in landscape mode **THEN** the system SHALL attempt to lock orientation if supported

### US-005: Touch Input Optimization
**As a** mobile player  
**I want** touch controls to work precisely  
**So that** I can interact with all game elements effectively  

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- **WHEN** a user touches the screen **THEN** the system SHALL accurately map touch coordinates through letterbox scaling
- **WHEN** multi-touch gestures are used **THEN** the system SHALL handle them appropriately for game controls
- **WHEN** touch events occur **THEN** the system SHALL prevent default browser behaviors (scrolling, zooming)
- **WHEN** UI buttons are touched **THEN** the system SHALL provide visual feedback within 100ms

### US-006: Performance Optimization
**As a** mobile player  
**I want** the game to run smoothly on my device  
**So that** I can enjoy uninterrupted gameplay  

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- **WHEN** the game runs on mobile **THEN** the system SHALL maintain at least 30 FPS on mid-range devices
- **WHEN** memory constraints are detected **THEN** the system SHALL optimize texture usage appropriately
- **WHEN** the device has limited GPU capabilities **THEN** the system SHALL adjust render settings
- **WHEN** battery saving mode is active **THEN** the system SHALL respect device power settings

### US-007: Future Vertical Mode Support
**As a** product owner  
**I want** the implementation to be extensible  
**So that** we can add vertical mode support in the future  

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- **WHEN** implementing mobile layout **THEN** the system SHALL use a modular orientation manager
- **WHEN** defining layout calculations **THEN** the system SHALL separate logic for horizontal and future vertical modes
- **WHEN** storing configuration **THEN** the system SHALL use an extensible format for orientation settings
- **WHEN** handling UI positioning **THEN** the system SHALL abstract position calculations for reusability

## Non-Functional Requirements

### NFR-001: Browser Compatibility
- The system SHALL support Chrome Mobile 90+, Safari iOS 14+, Firefox Mobile 88+, Samsung Internet 14+
- The system SHALL gracefully degrade on unsupported browsers with appropriate messaging

### NFR-002: Device Compatibility
- The system SHALL support devices with screen resolutions from 667x375 (iPhone SE) to 2732x2048 (iPad Pro)
- The system SHALL handle both notched and non-notched displays correctly
- The system SHALL work with both iOS and Android operating systems

### NFR-003: Performance Requirements
- The system SHALL add no more than 5ms to frame rendering time on mobile devices
- The system SHALL use no more than 10MB additional memory for mobile-specific features
- The system SHALL initialize mobile layout within 500ms of page load

### NFR-004: Maintainability
- The system SHALL implement device detection without external dependencies
- The system SHALL use existing Phaser 3 scaling capabilities where possible
- The system SHALL maintain clear separation between mobile and desktop code paths

## Constraints

### Technical Constraints
- Must use the existing Phaser 3 global window object pattern
- Cannot modify the core game resolution of 1920x1080
- Must maintain compatibility with existing UI positioning in GameConfig.js
- Cannot break existing desktop scaling behavior

### Design Constraints
- Letterbox bars must be pure black to match game aesthetic
- Game canvas must remain at exactly 1920x1080 logical resolution
- All UI elements must maintain their relative positions within the game canvas
- Touch targets must meet minimum size of 44x44 pixels for accessibility

## Assumptions
- Mobile devices have sufficient GPU capabilities for WebGL rendering
- Users understand and accept landscape orientation for gameplay
- Network connectivity on mobile is sufficient for server communication
- Device orientation APIs are available in target browsers

## Dependencies
- Phaser 3 framework (already in use)
- Browser orientation APIs for rotation detection
- Touch event APIs for mobile input handling
- Screen Wake Lock API for preventing sleep during gameplay (optional enhancement)

## Out of Scope
- Vertical/portrait mode support (reserved for future phase)
- Native app wrappers (Cordova, Capacitor)
- Offline mode or PWA capabilities
- Mobile-specific UI redesign
- Gesture-based controls beyond basic touch

## Success Criteria
1. Game displays correctly in landscape on all tested mobile devices
2. Letterboxing maintains 1920x1080 aspect ratio without distortion
3. Desktop functionality remains completely unchanged
4. Touch inputs map correctly to game coordinates
5. Performance meets or exceeds 30 FPS on target devices
6. Architecture supports future vertical mode addition
