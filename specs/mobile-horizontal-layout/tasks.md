## Rules & Tips

### Implementation Learnings

1. **Existing Configuration**: The game already had optimal mobile-ready configuration:
   - 1920x1080 resolution with FIT scaling mode
   - CENTER_BOTH auto-centering for letterboxing
   - Touch input configured with 3 active pointers
   - This means the game was already mobile-ready for landscape mode

2. **Service Architecture**: All new services follow the global window pattern:
   - `window.DeviceDetectionService` - Mobile/tablet detection with multi-method validation
   - `window.OrientationManager` - Orientation change handling with debouncing
   - `window.OverlayController` - Animation and visibility management
   - Singleton instances created automatically: `window.deviceDetection`, `window.orientationManager`, `window.overlayController`

3. **Device Detection Strategy**: Uses multi-layered detection for reliability:
   - Primary: User agent string matching
   - Secondary: Touch capability detection
   - Tertiary: Viewport width validation (<768px for mobile)
   - Platform-specific detection for iOS/Android

4. **Orientation Detection**: Implements multiple APIs for cross-browser compatibility:
   - `window.orientation` (deprecated but widely supported)
   - `screen.orientation.type` (modern browsers)
   - `matchMedia("(orientation: portrait)")` (fallback)
   - Window dimensions comparison (last resort)

5. **Animation Performance**: Uses CSS transitions with GPU acceleration:
   - Phone rotation animation with smooth keyframes
   - Fade in/out transitions with proper timing
   - Debounced orientation change handling (300ms) to prevent rapid firing

6. **Loading Integration**: Mobile services initialize during LoadingScene preload:
   - Early device detection before assets load
   - OrientationManager initialization with scene references
   - Automatic overlay display for portrait mode detection

7. **Error Handling**: Comprehensive fallbacks implemented:
   - Missing DOM elements gracefully handled
   - Service unavailability doesn't break initialization
   - Console logging with proper emoji prefixes for debugging

8. **Future-Ready**: Architecture designed for expansion:
   - Callback systems for custom integration
   - State management with detailed info methods
   - Easy to add more orientation modes or device-specific features

9. **Touch Optimization Implementation**: MenuScene button enhancements for mobile devices:
   - Implemented minimum 44x44px touch targets using custom hit areas
   - Mobile-specific visual feedback (color tint, enhanced scale on press)
   - Disabled hover effects on touch devices to prevent sticky hover states
   - Added pointerupoutside handling for proper touch cancel behavior
   - Maintained desktop functionality unchanged with device detection branching

10. **Mobile Spacing Optimization**: Enhanced MenuScene layout for better mobile user experience:
   - Implemented dynamic spacing multipliers based on screen height (0.8x for compact phones to 1.4x for large tablets)
   - Added responsive font sizing with 70%-100% scaling based on screen width to prevent oversized text
   - Optimized element positioning using percentage-based calculations instead of fixed pixels
   - Increased spacing between interactive elements (120px vs 50px for play button, 120px vs 100px for balance)
   - Maintained visual hierarchy while ensuring adequate touch target separation
   - Desktop layout remains completely unchanged with device detection branching

11. **Text Readability Enhancement**: Comprehensive text readability system for mobile devices:
   - Implemented categorized font scaling (small: 85%-110%, medium: 75%-100%, large: 60%-100%)
   - Enforced absolute minimum font sizes (14px for small text, 16px for medium text)
   - Added mobile-specific text stroke effects for better contrast against complex backgrounds
   - Enhanced color selection for better mobile visibility (lighter grays, consistent stroke thickness)
   - Applied responsive sizing to all text elements including buttons, status messages, and version info
   - Loading/validation text properly scaled with mobile-optimized stroke thickness
   - System prevents text from becoming unreadable on small screens while maintaining desktop appearance

12. **Orientation Change Game Integration**: Complete integration between OrientationManager and GameScene for smooth orientation transitions:
   - GameScene listens to global `orientationchanged`, `game:pause`, and `game:resume` events from OrientationManager
   - Comprehensive pause state handling: saves game state (spinning, autoplay, burst mode, cascade progress, sound status)
   - Disables all interactive elements during orientation pause to prevent state corruption
   - Pauses/resumes Phaser tweens, sound effects, and BGM during orientation changes
   - Shows optional semi-transparent overlay during pause for visual feedback
   - Auto-stops autoplay and burst mode during orientation changes for safety (requires manual restart)
   - Preserves cascade processing state and resumes seamlessly after orientation correction
   - Clean event listener management with proper cleanup in scene destroy method
   - Mobile-only activation with graceful fallback on desktop

13. **GameConfig UI Dimension Update**: Fixed responsive grid scaling mismatch between Phaser and UI positioning:
   - Updated DESIGN_WIDTH from 1280 to 1920 and DESIGN_HEIGHT from 720 to 1080 to match Phaser configuration
   - Adjusted UI_BOX_CENTER to proper 1920x1080 center point (960, 540)
   - Set UI_BOX_SCALE to 1.0 for native resolution scaling without downsizing
   - Reset GRID_OFFSET to (0, 0) for center-based positioning
   - Added 8px GRID_SPACING for better visual separation on mobile screens
   - This ensures consistent scaling between the Phaser FIT mode (1920x1080) and UI element positioning
   - Critical fix: Prevents UI elements from appearing misaligned or undersized on mobile devices

14. **Touch Input Optimization Already Complete**: Discovered comprehensive touch optimization already implemented in UIManager:
   - Mobile device detection automatically activates touch-specific behavior (no desktop impact)
   - All buttons use 44x44px minimum touch targets via custom hit areas with Phaser.Geom.Rectangle
   - Visual touch feedback implemented: press scales elements to 0.9-0.95x with subtle color tinting (0xCCCCCC)
   - Proper touch cancellation with pointerupoutside handlers that reset visual state
   - Enhanced spin button with original scale preservation and light effect synchronization
   - No overlapping touch zones - all interactive elements have properly spaced hit areas
   - Touch feedback only activates on mobile devices, desktop behavior unchanged
   - Complete implementation covers spin button, bet buttons, menu buttons, settings, and all interactive UI elements

15. **Mobile Gesture System Implementation**: Created comprehensive gesture detection framework for enhanced mobile interaction:
   - Implemented GestureDetectionService with tap, swipe, and hold gesture recognition
   - Mobile-only activation with automatic initialization in LoadingScene
   - Hold-for-auto-spin functionality: hold spin button for 800ms to activate 50-spin autoplay
   - Tap-to-spin already working through existing touch system (pointerup events)
   - Swipe gesture detection framework ready for future enhancements (swipe-to-spin, navigation)
   - Proper gesture boundary detection using Phaser getBounds() for accurate button targeting
   - Clean event listener management with proper cleanup in GameScene destroy method
   - Configurable thresholds: 50px swipe distance, 500ms swipe timeout, 800ms hold timeout
   - All gesture events dispatched as custom DOM events for extensibility

16. **Comprehensive Testing Framework Implementation**: Created complete testing and validation system for mobile horizontal layout:
