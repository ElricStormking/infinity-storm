# Mobile Horizontal Layout Implementation Plan

## Overview
Transform the Infinity Storm WebGL game client to support horizontal mobile gameplay with 1920x1080 aspect ratio, letterboxing for different screen ratios, and future vertical mode support.

## Requirements Summary
- Display game in landscape mode at 1920x1080 on mobile browsers
- Add black letterbox bars for non-16:9 aspect ratios
- Preserve all desktop functionality without breaking changes
- Show full-screen overlay with rotation prompt in portrait mode
- Design for future vertical mode support

## Technical Architecture

### Scale Configuration
```javascript
// Phaser 3 Scale Manager Configuration
scale: {
    mode: Phaser.Scale.FIT,
    parent: 'game-container',
    width: 1920,
    height: 1080,
    autoCenter: Phaser.Scale.CENTER_BOTH,
    min: { width: 960, height: 540 },
    max: { width: 1920, height: 1080 }
}
```

### Key Components
1. **DeviceDetectionService** - Mobile/tablet detection and capabilities
2. **OrientationService** - Orientation monitoring and state management
3. **ResponsiveScaleManager** - Dynamic scaling and letterbox handling
4. **RotationOverlay** - Full-screen portrait mode prompt
5. **TouchInputAdapter** - Touch event optimization for mobile

## Risk Mitigation
- **Risk**: Breaking desktop functionality
  - **Mitigation**: Feature flag for mobile enhancements
  - **Mitigation**: Comprehensive desktop regression testing

- **Risk**: Poor mobile performance
  - **Mitigation**: Quality settings for different device tiers
  - **Mitigation**: Asset optimization for mobile

- **Risk**: Touch input issues
  - **Mitigation**: Extensive device testing
  - **Mitigation**: Fallback to simpler input handling

## Estimated Timeline
- **Total Duration**: 40-52 hours (5-7 days)
- **Testing Buffer**: Additional 8-16 hours recommended
- **Documentation**: 4-8 hours

## Notes
- All changes must be backward compatible with desktop
- Use feature detection, not browser detection when possible
- Test early and often on actual devices
