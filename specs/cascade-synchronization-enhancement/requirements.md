# Enhanced Cascade Synchronization Requirements

## Overview
This document defines requirements to enhance the existing CLIENT_SERVER_SEPARATION_PLAN.md with bulletproof client-server cascade synchronization for the Infinity Storm slot game. The enhancement focuses on precise timing control and state management during complex multi-cascade spins.

## User Stories

### US-1: Server-Controlled Cascade Timing
**As a** game operator  
**I want** the server to dictate exact timing and order of all cascade sequences  
**So that** client-server state never desyncs during complex multi-cascade spins

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- EARS-1.1: **WHEN** server processes a spin with multiple cascades **THEN** server SHALL provide precise timing data for each cascade phase
- EARS-1.2: **WHEN** client receives cascade data **THEN** client SHALL execute cascades in exact server-specified order and timing
- EARS-1.3: **WHEN** network latency varies **THEN** timing SHALL remain consistent relative to game events not wall clock time
- EARS-1.4: **WHEN** cascades are in progress **THEN** client SHALL NOT accept new spin requests until sequence completes

### US-2: Symbol Drop Physics Control
**As a** game operator  
**I want** the server to provide detailed symbol drop timing, positions, and animation sequences  
**So that** symbol movements are deterministic and verifiable across client-server boundary

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- EARS-2.1: **WHEN** symbols are removed from grid **THEN** server SHALL specify drop sequences for replacement symbols including timing and physics parameters
- EARS-2.2: **WHEN** multiple symbols drop simultaneously **THEN** server SHALL provide individual timing offsets for realistic physics simulation
- EARS-2.3: **WHEN** symbols settle into position **THEN** client SHALL match exact final positions specified by server
- EARS-2.4: **WHEN** drop animations play **THEN** animation duration SHALL be server-controlled with fallback timing for network issues

### US-3: Win Animation Coordination
**As a** game operator  
**I want** the server to specify when and how win animations play during cascades  
**So that** win presentations are synchronized with game state changes

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- EARS-3.1: **WHEN** wins occur during cascades **THEN** server SHALL specify animation timing relative to cascade phases
- EARS-3.2: **WHEN** multiple wins happen in sequence **THEN** server SHALL provide animation coordination data to prevent overlaps
- EARS-3.3: **WHEN** burst mode triggers **THEN** server SHALL control activation timing and duration
- EARS-3.4: **WHEN** multiplier animations play **THEN** server SHALL specify reveal timing and accumulation sequences

### US-4: State Verification Checkpoints
**As a** game operator  
**I want** verification checkpoints during cascade sequences  
**So that** I can detect and handle client-server state mismatches immediately

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- EARS-4.1: **WHEN** each cascade phase completes **THEN** client SHALL send state checksum to server for verification
- EARS-4.2: **WHEN** state verification fails **THEN** system SHALL trigger immediate reconciliation without user disruption
- EARS-4.3: **WHEN** verification points are reached **THEN** server SHALL provide expected client state for comparison
- EARS-4.4: **WHEN** checksums match **THEN** cascade sequence SHALL continue to next phase

### US-5: Rollback and Recovery
**As a** game operator  
**I want** robust handling of mid-cascade network issues  
**So that** game flow never breaks and player experience remains smooth

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- EARS-5.1: **WHEN** network disconnection occurs mid-cascade **THEN** client SHALL preserve current animation state and queue remaining actions
- EARS-5.2: **WHEN** connection resumes **THEN** client SHALL resume cascade from last verified checkpoint
- EARS-5.3: **WHEN** reconnection fails within timeout **THEN** client SHALL display appropriate user feedback and preserve game state
- EARS-5.4: **WHEN** server detects client desync **THEN** server SHALL provide complete state reset data for recovery

### US-6: Performance During Complex Cascades
**As a** player  
**I want** smooth gameplay even during complex multi-cascade sequences  
**So that** my gaming experience is enjoyable regardless of cascade complexity

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- EARS-6.1: **WHEN** spins result in 5+ cascades **THEN** animations SHALL maintain 60fps performance
- EARS-6.2: **WHEN** multiple symbols animate simultaneously **THEN** system SHALL optimize rendering without visual degradation
- EARS-6.3: **WHEN** complex animations play **THEN** memory usage SHALL NOT exceed 200MB increase during sequence
- EARS-6.4: **WHEN** cascade sequences exceed 30 seconds **THEN** system SHALL provide skip option while preserving final state

### US-7: Audit Trail and Debugging
**As a** game operator  
**I want** complete audit trails of cascade synchronization  
**So that** I can debug issues and verify game integrity

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- EARS-7.1: **WHEN** cascade sequences execute **THEN** system SHALL log all timing data and state transitions
- EARS-7.2: **WHEN** synchronization issues occur **THEN** system SHALL capture detailed diagnostic data
- EARS-7.3: **WHEN** state verification fails **THEN** system SHALL log both client and server states for analysis
- EARS-7.4: **WHEN** recovery actions trigger **THEN** system SHALL record recovery method and success status

## Alternative Approaches Considered

### Option A: Client-Side Prediction with Server Validation
- **Pros**: Lower latency, smoother animations
- **Cons**: Complex rollback logic, potential security vulnerabilities
- **Decision**: Rejected due to security concerns

### Option B: Locked-Step Synchronization
- **Pros**: Perfect synchronization, simple logic
- **Cons**: Poor user experience with network latency
- **Decision**: Rejected due to latency sensitivity

### Option C: Server-Authoritative with Client Buffering (Selected)
- **Pros**: Security maintained, good UX, predictable behavior
- **Cons**: More complex implementation
- **Decision**: Selected for optimal balance of security and performance

## Questions for Clarification

1. **Cascade Complexity Limits**: What is the maximum number of cascades we should support in a single spin sequence?

2. **Animation Interruption**: Should players be able to speed up or skip cascade animations, and if so, how does this affect synchronization?

3. **Network Timeout Values**: What are the acceptable timeout thresholds for cascade synchronization before triggering recovery?

4. **State Checksum Method**: What specific data should be included in state checksums for verification (grid state only, or include animation positions)?

5. **Recovery User Experience**: During network recovery, should the game show a loading state or attempt to continue with placeholder animations?
